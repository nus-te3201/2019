The project below explains how to build a simple chat bot called Monty, adding functionality in small incremental steps.

{{ hr_double }}

<div id="monty1">

### Monty 1

Write a Python program to read in one user command and repeat it back to the user. An example output is given below.

```
>>> Hello, my name is Monty
>>> What can I do for you?
foo
>>> Your command is: foo
>>> Bye!
```

<panel type="seamless" header="Partial solution">

```python
print('>>> Hello, my name is Monty')
# ADD MORE CODE HERE
```
</panel>
</div>
{{ hr_double }}
<div id="monty2">

### Monty 2

Extend Monty 1 code to work as follows:

```
>>> Hello, my name is Monty
>>> What can I do for you?

list
>>> Nothing to list
>>> What can I do for you?

foo
>>> OOPS! Unknown command
>>> What can I do for you?

exit
>>> Are you sure? y/n
n
>>> What can I do for you?

exit
>>> Are you sure? y/n
y
>>> Bye!
```

<panel type="seamless" header="Partial solution">

```python
print('>>> Hello, my name is Monty')
while True:
    print('>>> What can I do for you?')
    # ADD MORE CODE HERE
print('>>> Bye!')
```
</panel>

</div>
{{ hr_double }}

%%Remaining increments to be added soon.%%
