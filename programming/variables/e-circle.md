1. Declare variables to represent the radius of a circle, and assign it value `7`.
1. Declare a variable to represent PI and assign it `3.14`
1. Calculate and assign the circumference of the circle to a new variable.
1. Use the previous variables to output the text `If radius is R, the circumference is C` where `R` and `C` are the radius and the circumference respectively %%&nbsp;e.g. `If radius is 7, the circumference is 43.96`%%.
