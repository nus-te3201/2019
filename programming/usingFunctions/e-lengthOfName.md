#### Exercise : Length of Name

Write a program to read a name from the keyboard and print the length of the name. Follow the example below:
```python
What is your name?
John Doe
The length of your name is 8
```
:bulb: In addition to functions `print` and `input`, you may need the `len` function %%&nbsp;e.g., `len('abc')` returns `3`%%.
