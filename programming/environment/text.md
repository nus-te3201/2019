### Setting up the Programming Environment

**Programming requires certain specialized tools** most of which are specific to the programming language being used. While some of these tools may come pre-installed in your computer, often you need to install and configure them yourself.

In the initial stages you can use an online programming environment to practice Python. 

<tip-box> 

:package: An example online Python programming tool you can use is [repl.it](https://repl.it/repls):

1. Go to [repl.it](https://repl.it/repls) and signup for a free account
1. Go to [https://repl.it/languages/python3](https://repl.it/languages/python3) (or choose _Python 3_ from the options in the web page) to enter the online Python environment

**Option 2. install python on your computer**

:exclamation: We recommend installing the latest Python `3.*` version (not the `2.*` version)

Programming in Java requires minimally the [_Java Development Kit (JDK)_](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html) to be installed in your computer. The JDK includes tools useful for developing and testing programs written in the Java programming language and running on the Java platform.
